# Code Wave

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The responsive version for wallets and wallet adapter may not function or work as expected for mobile based on plugin and wallet compatibility. For more code examples and implementations please visit the [Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com/)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Build and Run

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Features


### Structure

The scaffold project structure may vary based on the front end framework being utilized. The below is an example structure for the Next js Scaffold.
 
```

├── src : primary code folders and files 
│   ├── components : should house anything considered a resuable UI component
│   ├── contexts` : any context considered reusable and useuful to many compoennts that can be passed down through a component tree
│   ├── hooks` : any functions that let you 'hook' into react state or lifecycle features from function components
│   ├── models` : any data structure that may be reused throughout the project
│   ├── pages` : the pages that host meta data and the intended `View` for the page
│   ├── stores` : stores used in state management
│   ├── styles` : contain any global and reusable styles
│   ├── utils` : any other functionality considered reusable code that can be referenced
│   ├── views` : contains the actual views of the project that include the main content and components within
style, package, configuration, and other project files
